         ----ROCK PAPER SCISSOR SHOOT !----
   
    A classic two-person game. Players start each round by saying,
 “rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” On “shoot,” each player holds out
 their fist for rock,flat hand for paper, or their index and middle 
 finger for scissors. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cut paper, and paper 
 covers rock.See who wins each round! This is a good way to decide goes first
 in other games. In my project i did the same in C program , where one player 
 is enough to play with computer.
